    download from https://github.com/ERGO-Code. Compile it by calling 'make' in
    the top level directory of the package.

    - change BASICLUROOT to the location of the basiclu directory
    - change LAPACK and BLAS as necessary for linking with these libraries
    Then call 'make' in the top level directory.
