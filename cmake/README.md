*(1)* CMake C# is currently only supported for Microsoft Visual Studio 11 2012 and
  later. You can still build and run the HiGHS C# nuget package on Linux and MacOS with `dotnet`, see the workflows in the .NET column. It is only the CSharp example build with CMake that is not supported for Unix generators.

*(2)* Not tested yet.

## Introduction 

HiGHS can be built from source using CMake: <http://www.cmake.org/>. CMake works by generating native Makefiles or build projects that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

HiGHS can be built as a standalone project or it could be incorporated into an existing CMake project.

## Requirement
You'll need:

* `CMake >= 3.15`.
* A C++11 compiler

## Supported compilers 

Here is a list of the supported compilers:

* Clang `clang`
* GNU `g++`
* Intel `icc`
* Microsoft `MSVC`

# Build

To build the C++ library and executable run

``` bash
cd HiGHS
cmake -S. -B build 
cmake --build build --parallel
```

This generates HiGHS in the `build` directory and creates the [executable](@ref Executable) `build/bin/highs`, or `build/Release/bin/highs.exe` on Windows. To perform a quick test to see whether the compilation was successful, run `ctest` from within the build folder.

``` bash
ctest 
```

On Windows, the configuration type must be specified:
``` bash
ctest -C Release
```

## Install

The default installation location may need administrative
permissions. To install, after building and testing, run

``` bash
cmake --install build 
```

form the root directory. 

To install in a specified installation directory run CMake with the
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag set:

``` bash
cmake -S. -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/highs_install 
cmake --build build --parallel
cmake --install build
```

## Windows 

By default, CMake builds the debug version of the binaries. These are generated in a directory `Debug`. To build a release version, add the option `--config Release`

```shell
    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build --config Release
```

It is also possible to specify a specific Visual studio version to build with:
```shell
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -S . -B build
    cmake --build build
```

When building under Windows, some extra options are available.  One is building a 32 bit version or a 64 bit version. The default build is 64 bit. To build 32 bit, the following commands can be used from the `HiGHS/` directory:

```shell
    cmake -A Win32 -S . -B buildWin32
    cmake --build buildWin32
```

Another thing specific for windows is the calling convention, particularly important for the HiGHS dynamic library (dll). The default calling convention in windows is cdecl calling convention, however, dlls are most often compiled with stdcall. Most applications which expect stdcall, can't access dlls with cdecl and vice versa. To change the default calling convention from cdecl to stdcall the following option can be added
```shell
    cmake -DSTDCALL=ON -S . -B build
    cmake --build build
```

<!-- An extra note. With the legacy `-DFAST_BUILD=OFF`, under windows the build dll is called `highs.dll` however the exe expects `libhighs.dll` so a manual copy of `highs.dll` to `libhighs.dll` is needed. Of course all above options can be combined with each other. -->


# CMake Options

There are several options that can be passed to CMake to modify how the code
is built.<br>
To set these options and parameters, use `-D<Parameter_name>=<value>`.

All CMake options are passed at configure time, i.e., by running <br>
`cmake -S. -B<your_chosen_build_directory> -DOPTION_ONE=ON -DOPTION_TWO=OFF ...` <br>
before running `cmake --build <your_chosen_build_directory>`<br>

For example, to generate build files in a new
subdirectory called 'build', run:

```shell
cmake -S. -Bbuild 
```
and then build with:

```shell
cmake --build build
```

Following is a list of available options:
| CMake Option | Default Value | Note |
|:-------------|:--------------|:-----|
| `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | Release | see CMake documentation [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html) |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | ON(*) |  Build shared libraries (.so or .dyld). * OFF by default on Windows |
| `BUILD_CXX` | ON | Build C++ |
| `FORTRAN` | OFF | Build Fortran interface |
| `CSHARP` | OFF | Build CSharp wrapper |
| `BUILD_DOTNET` | OFF | Build .Net package |
| `PYTHON_BUILD_SETUP` | OFF | Build Python bindings. Called at `pip install` from pyproject.toml |
| `ZLIB` | ON | Use ZLIB if available |
| `ALL_TESTS` | OFF | Run unit tests and extended instance test set |

<!-- Following is a list of available options, for the full list run:

```shell
cmake -S. -Bbuild -LH
``` -->

HiGHS can be integrated into other CMake-based projects. 

# Integrating HiGHS in your CMake Project

If you already have HiGHS installed on your system, you can use `find_package()` to include HiGHS in your C++ CMake project. 

```
project(LOAD_HIGHS LANGUAGES CXX)

set(HIGHS_DIR path_to_highs_install/lib/cmake/highs)

find_package(HIGHS REQUIRED)

add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(main highs::highs)
```

The line 
```
set(HIGHS_DIR path_to_highs_install/lib/cmake/highs)
```
adds the HiGHS installation path to `HIGHS_DIR`. This is equivalent to building this project with
``` bash
cmake -DHIGHS_DIR=path_to_highs_install/lib/cmake/highs ..
```

Alternatively, if you wish to include the code of HiGHS within your project, FetchContent is also available as follows: 

```
project(LOAD_HIGHS LANGUAGES CXX)

include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    highs
    GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS.git"
    GIT_TAG        "latest"
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(highs)

add_executable(main call_from_cpp.cc)
target_link_libraries(main highs::highs)
```
