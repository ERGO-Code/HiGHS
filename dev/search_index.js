To use these requires knowledge of the corresponding (ordered) basic variables. This is obtained using the method getBasicVariables , with non-negative values being columns and negative values corresponding to row indices plus one [so -1 indicates row 0]. Methods getBasisInverseRow and getBasisInverseCol yield a specific row or column of B^-1. Methods getBasisSolve and getBasisTransposeSolve yield the solution of Bx=b and Bx=b respectively. Finally, the methods getReducedRow and getReducedColumn yield a specific row or column of B^-1A. In all cases, HiGHS can return the number and indices of the nonzeros in the result.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/other/#Other-Interfaces","page":"Other","title":"Other Interfaces","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/other/","page":"Other","title":"Other","text":"note: Note\nSome of the interfaces listed on this page are not officially supported by the HiGHS development team and are contributed by the community.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/other/#AMPL","page":"Other","title":"AMPL","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/other/","page":"Other","title":"Other","text":"HiGHS can be used via AMPL, see the AMPL Documentation.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/other/#GAMS","page":"Other","title":"GAMS","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/other/","page":"Other","title":"Other","text":"The interface is available at GAMSlinks, including pre-build libraries.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/other/#Javascript","page":"Other","title":"Javascript","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/other/","page":"Other","title":"Other","text":"HiGHS can be used from javascript directly inside a web browser thanks to highs-js.

At the optimal solution of a continuous model, some of the decision variables and values of constraint functions will be equal to their lower or upper bounds. Such a bound is said to be active. If a variable or constraint is at a bound, its corresponding dual solution value will generally be non-zero: when at a lower bound the dual value will be non-negative; when at an upper bound the dual value will be non-positive.

When unsolved, there is a bound on the optimal objective value for each such LP and, the greatest such bound is known as the dual bound. The optimal objective value of the MIP cannot be less than the dual bound. Hence the gap between the primal and dual bounds is a measure of progress of the MIP solver. Although the absolute gap is of some interest, the gap relative to the primal bound is a better measure. When the gap reaches zero then the MIP is solved to optimality.
