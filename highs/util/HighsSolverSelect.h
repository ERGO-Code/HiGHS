/**@file util/HighsSolverSelect.h
 * @brief Choose an LP algorithm (simplex / IPX / HiPO) from cheap
 *        structural features of the (presolved) model.
 *
 * Regenerating the models in HighsSolverSelectModels.h
 *
 * The models are fitted offline by the scripts in select/ of the HiGHS
 * test repo:
 *
 * 1. presolve_set.sh writes the presolved model of each instance.
 * 2. run_solvers.sh <version> LP|MIP times dual simplex, IPX and HiPO on
 *    the presolved LPs and on the LP relaxations of presolved MIPs.
 * 3. extract_features/ applies LP presolve, as solveLp sees the LP, and
 *    writes computeLpFeatures() of each model to a CSV.
 * 4. collect_results.py --version <version> writes select.csv.
 * 5. visualize.py --cpp-out <HiGHS>/highs/util/HighsSolverSelectModels.h
 *    fits the gradient boosted trees and writes the header.
 *
 * The models index highsLpFeatureVector() by position: changing the order
 * of the features, or what computeLpFeatures() computes, needs a refit.
 * The test solver-select-feature-order fixes the order.

// Effect of the options solver_select_strategy and
// solver_select_require_basis
//
// solver_select_strategy is a SolverSelectStrategy. It only acts where the
// user has left the choice of LP solver open:
//
// * LP (solveLp): when solver is "choose", the strategy is positive and
//   run_centring is false. Any other value of solver is used as given. The
//   choice is made for the LP after presolve. If there is a useful basis
//   then dual simplex is used, whatever the strategy
//
// * MIP (HighsLpRelaxation::run): solver plays no part. An LP with a valid
//   basis is solved by simplex. Otherwise mip_lp_solver "simplex", "ipm",
//   "ipx" or "hipo" is used as given, whatever the strategy. Only
//   mip_lp_solver "choose" defers to a positive strategy, and not when
//   simplex_strategy is primal. LPs solved using mip_ipm_solver are
//   unaffected
//
// If HiPO is selected but isn't available in the build, IPX is used
//
// A selected IPM solver has fallbacks that an explicit one doesn't
// (solveLpWithSelection): IPX if HiPO runs out of memory, and simplex if
// IPM fails, can't tell unbounded from infeasible, or yields no basis when
// one is needed. In the MIP solver, IPM is limited to 200 iterations for
// LPs with a simplex iteration limit
//
// Presolve precedes selection, so if the strategy may choose IPM then
// presolve allows for dual postsolve, as it does for solver "ipm"
//
// solver_select_require_basis makes a basis part of the result: a claim
// of optimality, infeasibility or unboundedness by a selected IPM solver
// without a basis is replaced by a simplex solve, and simplex is selected
// if run_crossover is "off". The MIP solver sets it,
// since it needs a basis. When false, a basis is only needed for an
// optimal solution when run_crossover is "on"
//
// Only strategies 0, 1 and 2 are documented for users. The rest are for
// development, but can still be set
