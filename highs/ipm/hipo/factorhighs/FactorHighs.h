/*

Direct solver for IPM matrices.

Consider a sparse symmetric matrix M in CSC format.
Only its lower triangular part is used; entries in the upper triangle are
ignored.
The matrix has n rows/cols and nz nonzero entries.
It is stored using three arrays:
- ptr, column pointers, of length n+1;
- rows, row indices, of length nz;
- vals, values, of length nz.

The direct solver uses the following objects:
- Symbolic, to store the symbolic factorization;
- FHsolver, to perform analyse and factorise phases.

Define a right-hand side rhs, which will be overwritten with the solution of
M^{-1} * rhs. Use reorderMetis, reorderAmd, reorderRcm to obtain a fill-reducing
ordering of the matrix, or use a precomputed one. The ordering is stored in the
array perm.

Zero-based indexing is assumed for the sparsity pattern and permutation. Use
setOneIndexing(true) to use one-based indexing.

Define a vector signs that contains the expected sign of each pivot:
-  1 for pivots expected to be positive
- -1 for pivots expected to be negative
-  0 for pivots without an expected sign.
This is used to determine the sign of the regularisation to apply.
Only pivots in the (1,1)-block are allowed to have unknown sign, so that pivots
with unknown sign receive a static regularisation contribution equal to -reg_p.
Dynamic regularisation uses the computed sign of the pivot, if the sign is
unknown.

Then, the factorization is performed as follows.

    Symbolic S;
    FHsolver FH;
    FH.analyse(S, n, nz rows, ptr, signs, perm);
    FH.factorise(S, n, nz rows, ptr, val);
    FH.solve(x);

Printing to screen is achieved using the interface in auxiliary/Logger.h.
Use setLogger to pass the Logger object to use: FH.setLogger(&logger).
To use printf instead, use FH.setLogger(nullptr,true).
Logging is off by default. Use FH.setLogger(nullptr, false) to switch logging
off.

To add static regularisation when the pivots are selected, use
setRegularisation(reg_p,reg_d) to choose values of primal and dual
regularisation. If regularisation is already added to the matrix, ignore.

Notice that the fill-reducing ordering can be modified during the call to
analyse. The inverse permutation used during the factorisation can be accessed
via the Symbolic object, S.iperm().
