# [Introduction](@id guide-introduction)

This guide describes the features of HiGHS that are available when it
is called from [`Python`](@ref python-getting-started), [`C++`](@ref
cpp-getting-started), [`C`](@ref c-api) and [`Fortran`](@ref
fortran-api). It is written in three sections: [basic](@ref
guide-basic), [further](@ref guide-further) and [advanced](@ref
guide-advanced). 

The [basic](@ref guide-basic) section will be sufficient for most
users. This and the [further](@ref guide-further) section cover the
`Python` interface `highspy`.  Although references to methods link to
`Python` examples, the method names and functionality for other
interfaces are as close as possible.

The [advanced](@ref guide-advanced) section covers features in the
[`C++`](@ref cpp-getting-started), [`C`](@ref c-api) and
[`Fortran`](@ref fortran-api) that are not in `highspy`.
