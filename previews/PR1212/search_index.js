For continuous models, each variable and constraint has an associated dual variable. The values of the dual variables constitute the dual solution, and it is for this reason that the term primal solution is used to distinguish the optimal values of the decision variables. At the optimal solution of a continuous model, some of the decision variables and values of constraint functions will be equal to their lower or upper bounds. Such a bound is said to be active. If a variable or constraint is at a bound, its corresponding dual solution value will generally be non-zero: when at a lower bound the dual value will be non-negative; when at an upper bound the dual value will be non-positive. When maximizing the objective the required signs of the dual values are reversed. Due to their economic interpretation, the dual values associated with constraints are often referred to as shadow prices or fair prices.

For an active bound, the corresponding dual value gives the change in the objective if that bound is increased or decreased. This level of analysis is often referred to as sensitivity. In general, the change in the objective is only known for a limited range of values for the active bound. HiGHS will return the limits of these bound ranges ranges, the objective value at both limits and the index of a variable or constraint that will acquire an active bound at both limits. For each variable with an active bound, the solution will remain optimal for a range of values of its cost coefficient. HiGHS will return the values of these cost ranges. For a variable or constraint whose value is not at a bound, HiGHS will return the range of values that the variable or constraint can take, the objective values at the limits of the range, and the index of a variable or constraint with a bound that will become in active at both limits.","category":"page"},{"location":"terminology/#MIP","page":"Terminology","title":"MIP","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"terminology/","page":"Terminology","title":"Terminology","text":"When solving a MIP, some or all the variables must take discrete values.

The objective value at such a point is an upper bound on the optimal objective value. The least such bound is known as the primal bound. The MIP solver generates a sequence of LP problems, each of which has bounds on the variables that are tighter than those of the original problem. When unsolved, there is a bound on the optimal objective value for each such LP and, the greatest such bound is known as the dual bound. The optimal objective value of the MIP cannot be less than the dual bound. Hence the gap between the primal and dual bounds is a measure of progress of the MIP solver. Although the absolute gap is of some interest, the gap relative to the primal bound is a better measure. When the gap reaches zero then the MIP is solved to optimality. However, it is often preferable to stop the MIP solver when the relative gap is below a specified tolerance.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/#Interfaces","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"There are HiGHS interfaces for C, C#, FORTRAN, Julia and Python in HiGHS/interfaces, with example driver files in HiGHS/examples.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/#Python","page":"Interfaces","title":"Python","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"Documentation for the Python interface is here.","category":"page"},{"location":"interfaces/#Julia","page":"Interfaces","title":"Julia","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interfaces/","page":"Interfaces","title":"Interfaces","text":"A Julia interface is available at HiGHS.jl.
