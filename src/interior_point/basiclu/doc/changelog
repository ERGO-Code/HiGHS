May 06, 2019: version 2.1

	- Reduce time of Markowitz search.
	  Maintain the minimum column and row count; start Markowitz
          search from this count rather than from 1. In fact, the old
	  version had an asymptotic bug.

	- Always remove columns from active submatrix when maximum is zero
  	  or less than the absolute pivot tolerance. Parameter
	  BASICLU_REMOVE_COLUMNS is now without effect.

	- Do not drop numerical zeros from active submatrix when drop
	  tolerance is negative.

	- Add user parameter BASICLU_SEARCH_ROWS.

	- Remove unused Julia code.

Aug 31, 2018: version 2.0

	Return LU factors with sorted indices to the user.
	Implement option to drop columns from the active submatrix.
	Report maximum entry of row eta vectors to user.
	Bug fix: lu_normest() requires uplo flag (produced wrong results).
	Report stability measure of LU factorization to user.
	Adapt Makefile from SuiteSparse.
	Version 2.0 is copyrighted by ERGO-Code.

Aug 6, 2017: version 1.1

	Bug fix in src/lu_build_factors.c: In version 1.0 the arrays
	Wflink and Wblink were not correctly initialized when the
	factorization was rank deficient.
